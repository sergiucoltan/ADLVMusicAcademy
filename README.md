Ad Libitum Voices Music Academy

• Ad Libitum Voices Academy is a web application of a music school,
through which a user-student can see: the Homepage of the school, the teachers of the school, 
can create an account and after register as a student, see school classes, see news,
make a subscription to a course and see their lessons.
• The application is also designed for : 
      - the school teachers, who can
create / modify lessons and courses; 
      - a manager-administrator of the school, that has full authorization and can monitor and manage all the information
from the database.
• The application can be used by 4 types of users, with specific authorizations:
Guest, User, Editor and Admin.

•To create this web application, I used:
 - ASP.NET MVC and the C # programming language
 - Repository (or Data Access Layer)
 - Bootstrap
 - jQuery
